The first thing we'll do is check your browser. GitHub supports the current versions of all major, modern browsers.

1. Determine your browser and version. If you need some help, [try this site](https://www.whatsmybrowser.org).
1. Confirm that it is one of the [officially supported browsers](https://help.github.com/en/articles/supported-browsers).

### Using Internet Explorer (IE), or an older version of a supported browser?
We strongly recommend using one of the supported browsers. If you're using IE, or an older version of a supported browser, it's likely you'll see erratic behavior on the GitHub user interface (UI).

If your machine is managed by your organization and you are unable to install one of the supported browsers yourself, check with your support team about installing it before you begin class. 

Do you have one of the supported browsers? If so, type "done". If you'd like to continue with the course despite not having the right browser, type "bypass". 

I'll respond when I detect a comment on this issue.
