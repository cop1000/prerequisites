Welcome! We can't wait to learn together.

In the meantime, we've created this course to help you get all the prerequisites you need to ensure you start class on the right foot.

Even if you're using GitHub Enterprise Server at your organization, most of our class will take place on GitHub.com, so we'll go through a few steps to ensure you're able to work on GitHub.com before class starts.
