Let's try cloning this repository.

Open your shell and type:

```shell
git clone {{ cloneURL }}
```

Your shell may ask you to authenticate with you  username and password. This is your GitHub username and password. Enter it when the prompt appears. The credentials will be encrypted and stored in your machine's [credential helper](https://help.github.com/en/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git). 

Paste in the response in the comments.
