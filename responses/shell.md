In class, you'll use your shell. The shell refers to the interactive interface used within your operating system. It is in this shell that you can execute commands and it will understand and perform those actions. Let's locate it. 

### :keyboard: Activity: Locate your shell

Use one of the following:
- In [macOS](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac), Unix, Linux, or similar operating systems, use the native Terminal application.
- For Windows, we recommend using **Git Bash**. Search your programs for Git Bash. If you don't already have it, not to worry, you'll download it in the next step. For now, feel free to use [Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/getting-started/getting-started-with-windows-powershell) or Command Prompt.
