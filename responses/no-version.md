The version you said isn't supported. However, anything above Git version 2.0 will work.

To install Git, either:
- download directly from git-scm.com,
- download from an approved software directory in your organization, or
- ask your organization's support team

When you've finished installing Git, verify its version by typing the following into your shell and paste the response in this issue.

```shell
git --version
````

I'll respond when I detect you've commented on this issue.
