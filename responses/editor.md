Git will work with any text editor. We recommend one of the following:

- Atom
- Visual Studio Code
- Notepad
- Vi or Vim
- Sublime
- Notepad++
- GitPad

Additionally, we can help you get started with some of these. Expand the text editor if you'd like additional instructions.

    <summary>Atom</summary>

1. Download Atom at https://atom.io. It may also already be installed on your machine, or downloadable through your organization's software directory as a pre-approved application.
1. Read the docs on [Git support](https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/version-control-in-atom/) and on [GitHub Support](https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/github-package/) already built into Atom.
1. There will be times when Git will ask you for input, to configure Atom as your editor at those times, type:
    ```shell
    git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"
    ```
    
    See the [docs on Atom as a Commit editor](https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/version-control-in-atom/#commit-editor) for more information.
